About Wynntils
========
Wynntils is a Wynncraft mod that seeks to enhance the user's gameplay with a variety of customizable options and additions.
If you find any bug or have crashed because of the mod, please report it at our <a href="https://discord.gg/SZuNem8">official Discord server</a>!

Setup the Workspace
========
To set up the workspace, you'll need to run the Forge ``setupDecompWorkspace`` gradle command, with that all the Forge source will be generated. It's that easy!
<br> Building the mod is even simpler. Just call the ``buildDependents`` and the artifact should be generated.

You can also setup a test environment. Using IntelliJ, execute the ``genIntellijRuns`` task, which will generate a run environment for you.
 
Pull Request
========
All pull requests are welcome. We'll analyse it and if we determine it should a part of the mod, we'll implement it.

We welcome all forms of assistance. =)

<strong>If you would like to make a pull request, please compare and merge it with Wynntils:development rather than Wynntils:master.</strong>
